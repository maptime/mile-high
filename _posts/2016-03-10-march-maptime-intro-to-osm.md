title: "March Maptime: Intro to OpenStreetMap w/ Founder Steve Coast"
---

Have you heard all about OpenStreetMap but haven't gotten around to diving in? Join us for an Introduction to OSM, presented by an *exceptionally* qualified guest: OSM Founder, [Steve Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coast)!

We'll cover some background on OSM and the basics of participating, then do some hands-on editing. If you've ever wanted to attend an OSM Mapathon, you'll be well prepared after this!

Be there **Thursday, March 10th** at CU Denver's Auraria Campus. We'll meet from 6-8pm in the North Classroom on the third floor, room 3015. Here are some [helpful maps](http://www.ahec.edu/about-auraria-campus/maps/) to get you there.

We'll have a some pizza and refreshments to enjoy while we chat. Remember, newcomers are always welcome, and *don't forget to bring a laptop!*
