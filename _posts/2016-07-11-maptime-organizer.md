Do you love maps? Do you love working with others? Do you love building open learning communities? Do you live in the greater Denver metro area? If so, Maptime MileHigh wants *YOU* to become an organizer!

One of our three organizers, Taylor Long, is stepping back to make time for the arrival of his first child. Organizers [Rachel Stevenson](https://twitter.com/uudreams) and [Ricardo Oliveira](https://twitter.com/roliveiraGIS) are looking for a new organizer (or two) to bring us back to a full-powered team.

### What's involved?
Being a Maptime organizer means you'll share responsibility for making our meetups happen. Organizers secure venues, set meetup dates, find presenters, order pizza, and facilitate discussion at the meetups. With three organizers, the effort can be balanced as needed.

### Why become an organizer?
Being a Maptime organizer is very rewarding. It's a great way to get your name out there in the local geo community as a person who likes to make things happen. It also connects you to a global community of Maptime organizers who chat frequently and even meet in person occasionally at Maptime summits!

### Do I need to be a mapping expert?
*Nope!* Maptime organizers don't have to be experts – the goal is to find other people in the community to present about what they know. It's much more important that you have organizational skills and enthusiasm. Being a beginner is actually valuable perspective for planning meetup topics and keeping Maptime accessible to all.

### How to become an organizer
Becoming an organizer is an informal process – simply send us a brief statement about yourself and we'll reply by the end of the month. In your statement, include the following:

1. Who are you?
2. Why do you want to be a Maptime MileHigh organizer?
3. Do you have any ideas for Maptime MileHigh?


**Please send us your statement to [maptimemilehigh@gmail.com](mailto:maptimemilehigh@gmail.com) ASAP (and no later than July 31st).** We'll accept organizers on a rolling basis, so don't delay!
