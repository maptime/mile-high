title: "Interactive Web Map Series #1: Intro to CSS and HTML"
---

This summer the Maptime Milehigh Leadership team is excited to bring you a series of workshops on interactive webmapping. There will be three workshops consisting of:

1. Introduction to HTML and CSS
2. Introduction to Leaflet and Adding Points Of Interest
3. Introduction to Github and putting your webmap online!

These workshops will not only help you to building an interactive web map but also allow us as a community to make an interactive webmap for NACIS ( North American Cartographic Information Society)  Annual Meeting being held in Colorado Spring this fall. More information can be found here: [nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting/](http://nacis.org/annual-meeting/current-meeting/)

In this first workshop, we'll be covering the basics of CSS and HTML â€” fundamental building blocks of all websites, and therefore, all webmaps.

Beginners are always welcome; all you need is a laptop and a willingness to learn! RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeMileHigh/events/232418000/).
