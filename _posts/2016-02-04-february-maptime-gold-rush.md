title: "February Maptime: How the 1859 gold rush put Colorado on the Map"
---

Join us on Thursday, February 4th to learn from guest speaker Wesley Brown how Colorado's gold rush shaped maps of today. _History, Cartography, Gold!_ This one will be fun!

### How the 1859 gold rush put Colorado on the Map

In the spring of 1858, Colorado's Front Range area was uncharted and inhabited only by natives.  But by the close of 1859, 100,000 fortune seekers had thoroughly explored the Front Range, north of Pueblo to the Wyoming border.  In their quest for gold, they left their footprints on the landscape, establishing dozens of settlements and blazing numerous trails.  This slide show and lecture will teach you about Coloradoâ€™s gold rush and how this important chapter of history influenced Colorado maps of today.
