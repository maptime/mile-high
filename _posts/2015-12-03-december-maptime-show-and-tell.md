title: "December Maptime: Show & Tell"
---

MaptimeMileHigh is back, and better than ever! Join us on Thursday, December 3rd at CU Denver's Auraria Campus. We'll meet from 6-8pm in a building called "North Classroom" on the third floor, room NC 3015. Here are some helpful maps to get you there.

Since MaptimeMileHigh has been on hiatus for a while, we're going to start out talking about what Maptime is and what we want it to be in Denver. Then, we'll share some maps we love.

Come with a link to a map that inspires you. We'll take turns sharing cool maps and talking about what makes them great and how they were made. Any map will do – digital or paper – and feel free to interpret "map" loosely. This kind of show and tell is a great way to get to know each other and learn what brings each of us to Maptime.

Feel free to post a link to your favorite map in the comments section below – this will make it easier to pull up at the meetup!

We'll have a some pizza and refreshments to enjoy while we chat. Remember, newcomers are always welcome (I expect most of you will be new this time around) and don't forget to bring a laptop!
